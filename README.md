# Noah's Weather Dashboard
Challenge 06 - Server Side API's

## Description
I built this project to demonstrate my understanding of using Server-Side API's on a web application. I used the OpenWeather API / fetch calls to retrieve response data from the API in order to load data onto my weather dashboard. The dashboard dynamically changes the data on it's main/forecast areas depending on which city has been searched, and data covering temperature, wind speeds, humidity, and current weather icons are displayed.

When I was working on this application I learned how to make multiple fetch calls that build off of the results of one another. I also learned how to have user input stored as a variable to be later used with "template literals" to make a string out of strings/variables. I also experimented with https://bulma.io/ for the first time to do the styling on my application. 

## Installation
This project is deployed on GitHub Pages and available to view.

## Usage
This project is used to check the weather of an city in the United States. The user can type up their desired city in the search bar, and once they've clicked submit, they will be able to see a list of information about the current weather/forecast for that particular city.

## Resources
Here is the link to the OpenWeather API I used in this project:
